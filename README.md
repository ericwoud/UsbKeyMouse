# Usb Key Mouse - Simple DIY laptop keyboard and touchpad to usb converter


This is an old stale project of mine that I published for anyone who might be interested in how to connect an old laptop keyboard and touchpad through a home-made usb converter.

This project only uses a [Sparkfun Pro Micro controller](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640), combined with a [4 to 16 Multiplexer breakout board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9056).

Links are pointing to the original products, however it works very well on cheaper clones too. With clones the whole project costs only a few Euro's.

Further more, you will need the connectors to your touchpad and keyboard.

Use the smallest soldering wire you can find for connecting all the inputs and outputs.

The program is written for a 16x8 matrix keyboard, in this case it is from an Asus 1201HA. It connects to a PS2 touchpad. All wiring is described in the code.
